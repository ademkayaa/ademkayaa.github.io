<h1 align="center">Niklaus Emil Wirth</h1>

<p>                Niklaus Emil Wirth was born in Switzerland,in 1934.
He is a swiss computer scientist.Wirth got a diploma in Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Instıtue of Technology in Zürich.
Then,he moved to study in North America,doing a master’s in 1960 at the universite Laval in Canada.
Then,Wirth went to the University of California,Berkeley,where he received his doctorate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  in 1963.
From 1963 to 1967,he subserved as assistant professor of computer science at Stanforfd University.He returned to Zurich as assistant professor,from 19968 until his retirement in 1999.

<p>                From 1962 to 1999,During his academic life contributed to computer science.
The most important contribütion is programming languages.He developed the programming languages Euler(1963),Algol-W(1966),PL 360(1968),Pascal(1970),Modula(1976),Modula-2(1979),and Oberon(1988).
After Pascal was published,was used programming language in computer science education .Pascal brings an important advantage of being easily understandable ,and however reduced  the lilkelihood of mistakes.
It impressed to many Professional programmers.Pascal was practiced on several big computers and was  used at many üniversities.Pascal could be confermed even on small computer

<p>            He won the Turing Award in 1984.Niklaus is famous these words “software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.” I think Wirth is right.
Because,it is produced a new software everyday and the  old is burried in history.but the hardware is consumed more slowly.
</p>
<p>            To sum up,Wirth lead to both hardware and software aspects of computer design and has written efficient books on software engineering and structure programming.
  Finally,he is a very valuable computer scientist.
